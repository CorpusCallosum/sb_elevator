# making CV better / more resilient

make a custom getBrightness
	for analysis, make it output the exact colors of every on/off segment
	transform brightness into color space (instead of analyzing a specific channel or the average)
	factor brightnessThreshold into PixelTracker

figure out when there's an error
	when a floor is greater than 26
	when a floor jumps more than 2 (3?)
	log the image of this, and which elevator had the issue

make a way to scrub through the debugged images (in debug mode)




# integrating real time

make a server to post data to
	iDigi or
	Heroku with Mongo

post data asynchronously

make the server get data with a "since" parameter (for polling from the client)
